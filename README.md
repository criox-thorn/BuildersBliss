<br><br>
Builder's Bliss is a minecraft builder's best friend. This application is aimed to help with block choices and your block palette. There are three main modes for builder's Bliss, they are the Palette, Gradient, and Texture Generators. In each mode blocks are matched that are the closest to the colour, this includes any included .jar mod files that include its own blocks. 

## Modes
### Palette Generator
The Palette Generator itself has two modes: Random and Picture.

The Random mode works like every other colour palette generator but instead assigning the five closest blocks to the individual colours. 

The Picture mode generates the user-defined-amount of colours from an uploaded image and then matches the blocks in the same way as the random mode.

### Gradient Generator
The Gradient Generator lets you choose two colours to merge between and the user-defined-amount of steps inbetween, then gives you the closest matching blocks to those colours. At any point in the line, clicking on a block will remove it and replace it with the next closest option.

### Texture Generator
The Texture Generator takes either a block or colour and gives the user-defined-amount of matches near it. Giving quick and easy texture to make your build interesting.
